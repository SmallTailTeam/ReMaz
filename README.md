Hello, random person who somehow managed to get into this repository, I'm willing to answer some questions you might have, but likely not, anyways.

### What's that?
A little musical game I'm working on, I'm planning on making it completely opensource.

<hr>

### Why's that?
Because I was willing to make one for ages, I even had a few attempts, though they were abandoned far before being released.

<hr>

### Do I have a plan this time?
Of course not.
